# GELD
###### A bookkeeping app
I have always been managing my personal finances in MS Excel (and even tried promoting my solution to others a couple of times â€“ here is [a kind of a tutorial](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BRcD2lGndHzWrKCKUYvo20z8WQZObremU5AhF63XFos/edit?usp=drive_web&ouid=100296723431598150507) I wrote in 2019 (in Russian only).  
But since I switched to IT in 2020, I inevitably started thinking how to transform and improve my bookeeping using JavaScript.  
And then I learnt Electron and realized it was what I actually need for that.

The app is expected to provide the following functionality:
- input your financial transactions in multiple assets and currencies
- view transaction history
- view your asset balances
- view statistics
- form a financial plan to forecast and prevent negative balance
- set up custom transaction categories and other parameters
- sync the data with a server to make it available on different platforms

Here is [the current design](https://www.figma.com/file/MOrVPFjmUoxY5SP60GZwkE/Geld?node-id=0%3A1&t=1VwI0HaAHx6txGWc-0) I made in Figma (enjoy this tool as well).
I am tracking my work on this project [in Trello](https://trello.com/invite/b/9hMsEXfe/ATTI4ec1b6955da35463a6a9f4e1a64e6a37713DAF6A/geld).

At the moment the project is not production- or deployment-ready. It can only be viewed now by downloading the code, installing the dependencies and running npm start (which should open a native window).
